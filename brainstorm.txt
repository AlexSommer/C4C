BRAINSTORM FOR CRUE APP
9/2/15

Key qualities: non-invasive, fun, minimalist (huge release importance, perhaps even hold back features for next release cycle...) 


TODO:
	-Talk to ConsentED/Cornell officials about focus group
		What issues occur?
		How do you address them? What has worked and not worked?
	-Filing for LLC for Crue
	-Cornell Shark Tank / Colgate Shark Tank
	-How do we know when a conversation/action goes from consentual and happy to non-consentual and sexual assault?
	-Are there tell-tale signs throughout the night in an interaction that made the person wary of assault or sketchy behavior before it happened?
		For instance, if a man/woman seems very drunk, does this statistically increase the chances of rape?
	-

Technical/Legal feasibility:
	-Knock Knock app phone vibration detection (for checking in feature?)
	-Checking in for user involvement for iOS (using Snapchat, Messages, etc...)

Fun Features:
-Planning who to go out with
-Meeting and adding new people dynamically (knock-knock feature, keep phone in pocket and knock twice)
-Losing people at the party
-Individual wants to leave the party
-Polls (where to next, group voting like FB poll)
	Permits people who didn't check their phone to know where others went and not feel left out
	People can vote and then see which friends they want to go with if they don't want to go somewhere with the rest of the group
	GPS can track where the people went
	Aggregate the polling + GPS to verify exactly where people are
		What if Bob said he is going to place A and then GPS sees he is at place D, can the app check with Bob to make sure he did this voluntarily?
	False positive case: you said you were going to place A and then met your crush along the way and decided to diverge from your path and are ALSO not answering your phone. Could you just knock on your phone with a characteristic 
-Phone activity
	

-How do we alert someone:
	Vibration and checkin with knocking
	
-How do we deal with privacy?
	Do we let anybody in the app track someone else?
	Do we let people turn off their tracking? How do we balance someone 	
	*How do we balance giving people their privacy but still keeping track of them and protecting them from danger?
	Do we only let the app have the data about locations and encapsulate that information in its entirety? Maybe it only reveals the information in danger situations?

-How drunk are you check in?
	Maybe the data is held only from the app
	Fun? way to check in but actually get legitimate information on lucidity
-Group management
	Tracking GPS
	Phone activity (using other apps)
	Low battery alert to other people
	Group alert message
	Override sound settings / vibration?
	Fluid and non-invasive
-"Getting laid" button

-How safe do you feel rating if you diverge from the path (would have to think what trigger this would be)?
	Then would be able to respond differently or check in differently
	

Safety Features:
-Location tracking with GPS
-*Fake call
	Fake call from the app that gives the person the opportunity to step away if they are liminally on the consentual/non-consentual side
	Helps get away from someone who is being creepy (safety side)
	Helps someone stop a conversation with someone boring, strange, or annoying (fun side)
-Quick, non-invasive check in

CAITLIN/LIZ IDEAS:
-The groupwide serious alert (like an Amber Alert)
-Let other people intervene and don't make a computer/algorithm determine whether someone is in danger


9/12/15 Brainstorm
-Jack Dent idea on recording when walking home at night?
	Is this feasible (drain on battery life)?
	Is this actually helpful from a data/ConsentED perspective? Does it do anything useful or is it a useless feature that will have no add-value?
